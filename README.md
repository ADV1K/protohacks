# Advik's Protohacks

## Protohacks? What?
Protohacks are a series of network programming challenges. 
The goal is to write a server for a given protocol and host it on a public IP.

> [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) challenges you to create servers for network protocols.
> We give you the protocol spec. You write the server and host it. We automatically test it. There's a global leaderboard for the fastest solve times.

## Testing
1. Grab your Public IPv6 (recommended) or IPv4 from [icanhazip.com](https://icanhazip.com/)
2. If you're behind a NAT, create an ssh tunnel from a VPS to your machine and use the IP of the VPS.
3. Run `make` to see a list of all the solutions.
4. Run `make <solution>` to run a specific solution.
5. Go to [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/problems) and check your solution.
